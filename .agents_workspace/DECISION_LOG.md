# Decision Log

### Entry 1

**Type:** Decision
**Mode:** Autonomous
**Timestamp:** 2026-07-12T00:00:00Z
**Task:** Implement mcp-cassette from SKELETON + ITER_01..04 plan (full sequence to MVP terminator ITER_04).

**Context:** The plan lists per-iteration pytest suites and a tests/reference_server as deliverables, but my standing instructions default to not writing tests unless asked. This materially changes deliverable scope.
**Decision:** Asked the user; they chose "Build everything incl. test suites". Implementing production code plus the full pytest suites the plan specifies.
**Impact / Risk:** Larger surface; test suites exercise stdio subprocess behavior that is Linux/macOS-targeted (Windows out of MVP scope per SKELETON §03) and may not run on the current win32 host.
**Outcome:** Full suite implemented; 43 passed, 1 skipped on the win32 host. The one skip is the SIGTERM-finalize test (POSIX-only signal handling, Windows out of MVP scope). Record/replay/faults/fixture all run on Windows despite it being out of scope.

### Entry 2

**Type:** Decision
**Mode:** Autonomous
**Timestamp:** 2026-07-12T00:00:00Z
**Task:** Cassette schema closed-set field typing.

**Context:** Architecture invariant prefers Python StrEnum for closed sets, but StrEnum is 3.11+ and the plan floor is Python 3.10.
**Decision:** Use typing.Literal for closed-set fields (sender, kind, transport, ordering, on_unmatched, fault type, malformed strategy). Literal is a closed set, pydantic-native, and 3.10-compatible.
**Impact / Risk:** None material; validation errors are still readable and the set is closed to external callers.
**Outcome:** Applied.

### Entry 3

**Type:** Decision
**Mode:** Autonomous
**Timestamp:** 2026-07-12T00:00:00Z
**Task:** Build strategy across the iteration sequence.

**Context:** implement-from-plan says implement section by section; but the target is the whole sequence to the ITER_04 MVP terminator, and several files (proxy.py, replay/server.py, cli.py, matching.py) are stubbed in SKELETON then made real in later iterations.
**Decision:** Build each module directly to its final ITER_04 state rather than writing a stub and overwriting it repeatedly. Skeleton-only stub semantics (loud failure messages) are preserved only for surfaces that remain stubs at their point in the sequence; since the target is the full MVP, all surfaces reach real implementations.
**Impact / Risk:** Avoids churn; the intermediate loud-stub states are not committed, which is fine because the target is the terminal MVP, not an intermediate iteration.
**Outcome:** Applied.

### Entry 4

**Type:** Decision
**Mode:** Autonomous
**Timestamp:** 2026-07-13T00:00:00Z
**Task:** `new_episodes` record-mode semantics (ITER_03 §04).

**Context:** The plan specifies `new_episodes` as "replay; unmatched requests fall through to the real server and are appended." For a stateful stdio MCP session this is under-specified: a freshly spawned real server has no session context, so forwarding only misses would send a mid-session `tools/call` to an uninitialized server.
**Decision:** In `NewEpisodesProxy`, always forward `initialize` and client notifications live (giving the real server a valid handshake) and intercept only matched non-initialize requests from the cassette; misses fall through and are appended. Documented the ordering caveat (concurrent free-running server notifications during a fall-through are captured but not ordering-guaranteed) in the module docstring.
**Impact / Risk:** Correct for the serial request/response sessions agent suites produce; the caveat is noted. Appended episodes go through the same redaction path as fresh recordings.
**Outcome:** Applied; `test_new_episodes_appends_novel_call` passes.

### Entry 5

**Type:** Note
**Mode:** Autonomous
**Timestamp:** 2026-07-13T00:00:00Z
**Task:** Two transport bugs found and fixed during validation.

**Context:** Integration tests initially hung or dropped the last response.
**Decision:** (1) argparse `REMAINDER` positional swallowed flags placed after the cassette positional in `serve`; replaced with a manual split of argv on the first standalone `--`. (2) anyio `FileReadStream(sys.stdin.buffer)` uses a *buffered* reader whose `read(n)` blocks until n bytes or EOF, stalling an interactive proxy that has received one short line; `FileWriteStream(sys.stdout.buffer)` buffers responses. Fixed by reading/writing unbuffered raw fds (`os.fdopen(..., buffering=0)`) in `src/mcp_cassette/_stdio.py`.
**Impact / Risk:** Both are core to the streaming stdio transport working at all. Covered by the record/replay/fault suites.
**Outcome:** Fixed; suite green.

### Entry 6

**Type:** Decision
**Mode:** Autonomous
**Timestamp:** 2026-07-13T00:00:00Z
**Task:** ITER_05 — Windows support (post-MVP): scope and shutdown design.

**Context:** The goal was "add Windows support." Empirically the suite already passed on Windows (43 passed, 1 skipped); the only real gap was graceful shutdown of the recording proxy on Ctrl+C/Ctrl+Break, because `anyio.open_signal_receiver` is unavailable on Windows and the code fell back to `sleep_forever()`. A first design (poll a `signal.signal` flag, then cancel the task group like POSIX) hung: Windows cannot EINTR-interrupt the worker thread blocked in our own stdin read, so the task-group unwind never completes.
**Decision:** On the Windows interrupt path, do not cancel the group. Instead terminate the child (shielded), call `_finalize()` to write the cassette, then `os._exit(130)`. The un-joinable stdin thread dies with the process; the cassette is already saved. POSIX keeps its clean cancel-based unwind. Left `new_episodes` unchanged (EOF-driven on all platforms already — no new Windows gap). Included a minimal GitHub Actions CI (OS matrix incl. windows-latest) to guard the claim, but dropped the `ruff format --check` step because the repo has pre-existing format drift (never `ruff format`'d, only lint-clean); reformatting the whole tree is out of scope for this task.
**Impact / Risk:** `os._exit` is blunt but correct for a shutdown path with the artifact already persisted; commented in-source. The Ctrl+Break test needs a real Windows console to deliver the event, so it skips (never hangs) under `uv run`/pty launchers — it asserts exit-130/finalize when a console is present (verified from PowerShell) and skips cleanly otherwise.
**Outcome:** Applied. `uv run pytest` → 44 passed, 1 skipped; ruff + mypy clean; Ctrl+Break finalize verified rc 130 from a real console.

### Entry 7

**Type:** Decision
**Mode:** Autonomous
**Timestamp:** 2026-07-14T00:00:00Z
**Task:** Bump Python floor to 3.12+, add examples, verify pre-commit, add version-parity CI.

**Context:** Verifying the pre-commit hook per the goal required `pre-commit run --all-files`, which reformatted 11 pre-existing src/ and tests/ files. Entry 6 had deliberately left this format drift in place ("reformatting the whole tree is out of scope"). The floor bump also collapsed uv.lock's version-conditional markers (~360 fewer lines).
**Decision:** Kept the repo-wide reformats. The user explicitly asked to check the pre-commit hook works; the hook's correct operation *is* those fixes (pure line-collapsing + lint autofixes, no semantic change — ruff 0.15.21 is now the resolved dev version, so committed code was simply stale). Reverting would leave the very hook being verified failing on `--all-files`. Ran `uv lock` to keep the lockfile consistent with `requires-python = ">=3.12"`. Left planning artifacts (SKELETON.md, earlier DECISION_LOG entries) referencing 3.10 untouched as historical record.
**Impact / Risk:** Diff now touches 11 files beyond the four deliverables, but all are mechanical format/lint autofixes the project's own tooling enforces; suite stays green (43 passed, 2 skipped). Note: `pre-commit run --all-files` only covers git-tracked files, so newly-added untracked examples/scripts were not linted by the hook — caught 4 E501s with `ruff check .` and fixed them.
**Outcome:** Applied. ruff check + format clean, mypy clean, main suite 43 passed/2 skipped, examples 3 passed offline (mode=none), version-check script exits 0.

### Entry 8

**Type:** Decision
**Mode:** Autonomous
**Timestamp:** 2026-07-18T00:00:00+08:00
**Task:** Full-coverage test suite for v1 + test folder reorganization

**Context:** "Full code coverage" required choices the request left open: how to measure coverage when most code runs in subprocesses and as a pre-imported pytest plugin; what to do with unreachable defensive code; what gate threshold survives a 3-OS CI matrix; and how to split tests into unit/integration/system without package __init__ files.
**Decision:** (1) Measure with bare `coverage run -m pytest` + `patch = ["subprocess"]` + `parallel`/`combine` instead of pytest-cov — pytest-cov starts too late to see the pytest11-registered plugin and misses subprocesses; swapped the pytest-cov dev dep for `coverage>=7.10`. (2) Unreachable guards get `# pragma: no cover`/`no branch` with an inline reason rather than deletion (minimal-change bias; the guards document intent). (3) The Windows `os._exit(130)` shutdown path is unmeasurable via subprocess coverage, so it is tested in-process against private methods with a stubbed child process and mocked `os._exit`. (4) `fail_under = 99`, not 100: proxy.py lines 87-88/124-126 are POSIX-only (anyio signal receiver) and unreachable on Windows; 99 holds on every matrix OS. (5) Folder split keeps shared helpers at tests/ root via `pythonpath = ["tests"]`; test basenames stay unique across layers because there are no `__init__.py` files (pytest import-mode constraint); the CLI `--redact` subprocess test moved to integration/test_record.py, session/plugin unit tests split out of the fixture system tests.
**Impact / Risk:** Tests that reach private methods (`_watch_signals_windows`, `_handle_line`, `_replay`) will need updating if those internals are refactored. The 99 gate would mask a small future regression on the platform that already misses the POSIX-only lines.
**Outcome:** 118 passed, 2 skipped; every module 100% except record/proxy.py (94% on Windows, POSIX-only lines); gate passes locally; ruff and mypy --strict clean.
