"""A minimal transport-level JSON-RPC client used by the examples.

Launches a server *command* (the real server, mcp-cassette's recording proxy, or its
replay server — they are interchangeable, which is the point), sends newline-delimited
JSON-RPC requests, and collects the JSON objects written back. Pure standard library;
no MCP client SDK, because mcp-cassette works at the transport level.
